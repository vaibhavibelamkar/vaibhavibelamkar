## 📝 About Me :

Hey there! 👋 
I’m **Vaibhavi Belamkar**, a Computer Science student at **NBNSCOE**, class of 2026.  

My journey in tech started from scratch; I initially had little understanding of computers. 

However, my curiosity led me to explore and discover a genuine interest in Coding. As I immersed myself in Programming, I found a deep passion for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and developed a keen interest in Web Development. **

Through platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, I have honed my problem-solving skills and enjoy turning complex challenges into elegant solutions. I thrive on the excitement of building impactful applications and continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in these fields.
