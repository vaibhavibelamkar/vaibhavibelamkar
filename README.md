## 🎓 About Me  :

Hey there! 👋 
I’m **Vaibhavi Belamkar**, a Computer Science student at **NBNSCOE**, class of 2026.  

My journey in tech started from scratch; I initially had little understanding of computers. 

However, my curiosity led me to explore and discover a genuine interest in Coding. As I immersed myself in Programming, I found a deep passion for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and developed a keen interest in Web Development. 

Through platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, I have honed my problem-solving skills and enjoy turning complex challenges into elegant solutions. I thrive on the excitement of building impactful applications and continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in these fields. 

Let's connect and see how we can create something amazing together!
